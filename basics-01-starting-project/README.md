A Javascript course from Fundamentals to Advanced Concepts

#Template Literals

- Syntax: `(${variable})`
- Allows you to insert dynamic variables inside a string. They are preferred to concatenation since they are easier to read. You can also use this to write multi-line strings to help with readability. 

- You can use \n to display a string in a new line within the quotes of a string. the backslash escapes the next character from normal syntax


#Functions
Functions that work without any input do not require a parameter. When JS sees your function, it doesn't get executed immediately, it stores it in memory waiting for the function call.
