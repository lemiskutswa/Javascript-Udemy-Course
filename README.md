A Javascript course from Fundamentals to Advanced Concepts

#Template Literals

- Syntax: `(${variable})`
- Allows you to insert dynamic variables inside a string. They are preferred to concatenation since they are easier to read. You can also use this to write multi-line strings to help with readability. 

- You can use \n to display a string in a new line within the quotes of a string. the backslash escapes the next character from normal syntax


<h1 style='color: #DC143C;'>Functions</h1>
Functions that work without any input do not require a parameter. When JS sees your function, it doesn't get executed immediately, it stores it in memory waiting for the function call. 

You can only pass values during calling if a function has parameters. 

You can call the function before defining it and it still works. This is because the browser first reads your script and registers any functions before it can begin execution. 

In a function, you can access global scope variables/constants, but you can't do the reverse. \n 
The return statement *completes function execution*

You can execute functions indirectly by naming the function for example in an event listener without including the brackets. This ensures that the function is not executed when the browser is parsing the srcipt.
